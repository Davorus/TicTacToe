# TicTacToe

## Functionality

Inside of the `int main()` method is only an instance of the `Gamesetup_Handler`, which has the menu lead implemented and sets up the whole game. Playerinitialization is taken by the `Game_Handler` and the playermanagement itself. `Playfield_Handler` takes care of printing the playfield and if a player has won.

## How to run the code

All you have to open Visual Studio Code, you need to have a C++ compiler and a code runner
